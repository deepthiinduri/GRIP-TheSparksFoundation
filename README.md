## Task 1 - Prediction using Supervised ML

The task deals with predicting the percentage of students based on the number of study hours.

We will be using simple linear regression to build our model and to make predictions. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

## Task 6 - Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
